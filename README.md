# 30DayChartChallenge
A #DataViz challenge by @CedScherer  and  @dr_xeo

Hi, this is my first project on using R visualization extensively. 
To accomplish this task i have to create 30 visualization. We can use any kind of visualization, but i tend to use R to make my understanding about it better.
