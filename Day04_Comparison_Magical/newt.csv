"The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham."
Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judah and his brethren;
and Judah begat Perez and Zerah of Tamar; and Perez begat Hezron; and Hezron begat Ram;
and Ram begat Amminadab; and Amminadab begat Nahshon; and Nahshon begat Salmon;
and Salmon begat Boaz of Rahab; and Boaz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;
and Jesse begat David the king. And David begat Solomon of her `that had been the wife' of Uriah;
and Solomon begat Rehoboam; and Rehoboam begat Abijah; and Abijah begat Asa;
and Asa begat Jehoshaphat; and Jehoshaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Uzziah;
and Uzziah begat Jotham; and Jotham begat Ahaz; and Ahaz begat Hezekiah;
and Hezekiah begat Manasseh; and Manasseh begat Amon; and Amon begat Josiah;
"and Josiah begat Jechoniah and his brethren, at the time of the carrying away to Babylon."
"And after the carrying away to Babylon, Jechoniah begat Shealtiel; and Shealtiel begat Zerubbabel;"
and Zerubbabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;
and Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud;
and Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;
"and Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ."
So all the generations from Abraham unto David are fourteen generations; and from David unto the carrying away to Babylon fourteen generations; and from the carrying away to Babylon unto the Christ fourteen generations.
"Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Spirit."
"And Joseph her husband, being a righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily."
"But when he thought on these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit."
And she shall bring forth a son; and thou shalt call his name JESUS; for it is he that shall save his people from their sins.
"Now all this is come to pass, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,"
"Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, And they shall call his name Immanuel; which is, being interpreted, God with us."
"And Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took unto him his wife;"
and knew her not till she had brought forth a son: and he called his name JESUS.
"Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, Wise-men from the east came to Jerusalem, saying,"
"Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we saw his star in the east, and are come to worship him."
"And when Herod the king heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him."
"And gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ should be born."
"And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written through the prophet,"
"And thou Bethlehem, land of Judah, Art in no wise least among the princes of Judah: For out of thee shall come forth a governor, Who shall be shepherd of my people Israel."
"Then Herod privily called the Wise-men, and learned of them exactly what time the star appeared."
"And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search out exactly concerning the young child; and when ye have found `him,' bring me word, that I also may come and worship him."
"And they, having heard the king, went their way; and lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was."
"And when they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy."
"And they came into the house and saw the young child with Mary his mother; and they fell down and worshipped him; and opening their treasures they offered unto him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh."
"And being warned `of God' in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way."
"Now when they were departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I tell thee: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him."
"And he arose and took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt;"
"and was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt did I call my son."
"Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the Wise-men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the male children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the borders thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had exactly learned of the Wise-men."
"Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying,"
"A voice was heard in Ramah, Weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children; And she would not be comforted, because they are not."
"But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying,"
"Arise and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead that sought the young child's life."
"And he arose and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel."
"But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither; and being warned `of God' in a dream, he withdrew into the parts of Galilee,"
"and came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets, that he should be called a Nazarene."
"And in those days cometh John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea, saying,"
Repent ye; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
"For this is he that was spoken of through Isaiah the prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make ye ready the way of the Lord, Make his paths straight."
"Now John himself had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his food was locusts and wild honey."
"Then went out unto him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about the Jordan;"
"and they were baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins."
"But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said unto them, Ye offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
Bring forth therefore fruit worthy of repentance:
"and think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham."
"And even now the axe lieth at the root of the trees: every tree therefore that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire."
"I indeed baptize you in water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit and `in' fire:"
"whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing-floor; and he will gather his wheat into the garner, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire."
"Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him."
"But John would have hindered him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?"
"But Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer `it' now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffereth him."
"And Jesus when he was baptized, went up straightway from the water: and lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him;"
"and lo, a voice out of the heavens, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.
"And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he afterward hungered."
"And the tempter came and said unto him, If thou art the Son of God, command that these stones become bread."
"But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God."
"Then the devil taketh him into the holy city; and he set him on the pinnacle of the temple,"
"and saith unto him, If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and, On their hands they shall bear thee up, Lest haply thou dash thy foot against a stone."
"Jesus said unto him, Again it is written, Thou shalt not make trial of the Lord thy God."
"Again, the devil taketh him unto an exceeding high mountain, and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;"
"and he said unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me."
"Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve."
"Then the devil leaveth him; and behold, angels came and ministered unto him."
"Now when he heard that John was delivered up, he withdrew into Galilee;"
"and leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali:"
"that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,"
"The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, Toward the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles,"
"The people that sat in darkness Saw a great light, And to them that sat in the region and shadow of death, To them did light spring up."
"From that time began Jesus to preach, and to say, Repent ye; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
"And walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brethren, Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishers."
"And he saith unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you fishers of men."
"And they straightway left the nets, and followed him."
"And going on from thence he saw two other brethren, James the `son' of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them."
"And they straightway left the boat and their father, and followed him."
"And Jesus went about in all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of disease and all manner of sickness among the people."
"And the report of him went forth into all Syria: and they brought unto him all that were sick, holden with divers diseases and torments, possessed with demons, and epileptic, and palsied; and he healed them."
And there followed him great multitudes from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judaea and `from' beyond the Jordan.
"And seeing the multitudes, he went up into the mountain: and when he had sat down, his disciples came unto him:"
"and he opened his mouth and taught them, saying,"
Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.
Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.
Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.
Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called sons of God.
Blessed are they that have been persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
"Blessed are ye when `men' shall reproach you, and persecute you, and say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake."
"Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets that were before you."
"Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost its savor, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under foot of men."
Ye are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hid.
"Neither do `men' light a lamp, and put it under the bushel, but on the stand; and it shineth unto all that are in the house."
"Even so let your light shine before men; that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven."
"Think not that I came to destroy the law or the prophets: I came not to destroy, but to fulfil."
"For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass away from the law, till all things be accomplished."
"Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven."
"For I say unto you, that except your righteousness shall exceed `the righteousness' of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven."
"Ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:"
"but I say unto you, that every one who is angry with his brother shall be in danger of the judgment; and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council; and whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of the hell of fire."
"If therefore thou art offering thy gift at the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath aught against thee,"
"leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way, first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift."
"Agree with thine adversary quickly, while thou art with him in the way; lest haply the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison."
"Verily I say unto thee, thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou have paid the last farthing."
"Ye have heard that it was said, Thou shalt not commit adultery:"
"but I say unto you, that every one that looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart."
"And if thy right eye causeth thee to stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not thy whole body be cast into hell."
"And if thy right hand causeth thee to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not thy whole body go into hell."
"It was said also, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:"
"but I say unto you, that every one that putteth away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, maketh her an adulteress: and whosoever shall marry her when she is put away committeth adultery."
"Again, ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:"
"but I say unto you, swear not at all; neither by the heaven, for it is the throne of God;"
"nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King."
"Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, for thou canst not make one hair white or black."
"But let your speech be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: and whatsoever is more than these is of the evil `one'."
"Ye have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:"
"but I say unto you, resist not him that is evil: but whosoever smiteth thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also."
"And if any man would go to law with thee, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also."
"And whosoever shall compel thee to go one mile, go with him two."
"Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away."
"Ye have heard that it was said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thine enemy:"
"but I say unto you, love your enemies, and pray for them that persecute you;"
"that ye may be sons of your Father who is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust."
"For if ye love them that love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?"
"And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more `than others?' do not even the Gentiles the same?"
"Ye therefore shall be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect."
"Take heed that ye do not your righteousness before men, to be seen of them: else ye have no reward with your Father who is in heaven."
"When therefore thou doest alms, sound not a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have received their reward."
"But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:"
that thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father who seeth in secret shall recompense thee.
"And when ye pray, ye shall not be as the hypocrites: for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have received their reward."
"But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thine inner chamber, and having shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret, and thy Father who seeth in secret shall recompense thee."
"And in praying use not vain repetitions, as the Gentiles do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking."
"Be not therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him."
"After this manner therefore pray ye. Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name."
"Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so on earth."
Give us this day our daily bread.
"And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors."
"And bring us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil `one.'"
"For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you."
"But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses."
"Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may be seen of men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have received their reward."
"But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thy head, and wash thy face;"
"that thou be not seen of men to fast, but of thy Father who is in secret: and thy Father, who seeth in secret, shall recompense thee."
"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon the earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break through and steal:"
"but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth consume, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:"
"for where thy treasure is, there will thy heart be also."
"The lamp of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light."
"But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is the darkness!"
"No man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon."
"Therefore I say unto you, be not anxious for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than the food, and the body than the raiment?"
"Behold the birds of the heaven, that they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; and your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are not ye of much more value then they?"
And which of you by being anxious can add one cubit unto the measure of his life?
"And why are ye anxious concerning raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:"
"yet I say unto you, that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these."
"But if God doth so clothe the grass of the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven, `shall he' not much more `clothe' you, O ye of little faith?"
"Be not therefore anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?"
For after all these things do the Gentiles seek; for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.
"But seek ye first his kingdom, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you."
Be not therefore anxious for the morrow: for the morrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.
"Judge not, that ye be not judged."
"For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured unto you."
"And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?"
"Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me cast out the mote out of thine eye; and lo, the beam is in thine own eye?"
"Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye."
"Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast your pearls before the swine, lest haply they trample them under their feet, and turn and rend you."
"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:"
for every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.
"Or what man is there of you, who, if his son shall ask him for a loaf, will give him a stone;"
"or if he shall ask for a fish, will give him a serpent?"
"If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father who is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?"
"All things therefore whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, even so do ye also unto them: for this is the law and the prophets."
"Enter ye in by the narrow gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many are they that enter in thereby."
"For narrow is the gate, and straitened the way, that leadeth unto life, and few are they that find it."
"Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravening wolves."
"By their fruits ye shall know them. Do `men' gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?"
Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but the corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.
"A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit."
"Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire."
Therefore by their fruits ye shall know them.
"Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father who is in heaven."
"Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy by thy name, and by thy name cast out demons, and by thy name do many mighty works?"
"And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity."
"Every one therefore that heareth these words of mine, and doeth them, shall be likened unto a wise man, who built his house upon the rock:"
"and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and if fell not: for it was founded upon the rock."
"And every one that heareth these words of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand:"
"and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and smote upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall thereof."
"And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these words, the multitudes were astonished at his teaching:"
