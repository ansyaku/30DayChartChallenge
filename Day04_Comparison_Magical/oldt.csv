In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
And the earth was waste and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep: and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
"And God said, Let there be light: and there was light."
"And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness."
"And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day."
"And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters."
"And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so."
"And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day."
"And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so."
And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
"And God said, Let the earth put forth grass, herbs yielding seed, `and' fruit-trees bearing fruit after their kind, wherein is the seed thereof, upon the earth: and it was so."
"And the earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, wherein is the seed thereof, after their kind: and God saw that it was good."
"And there was evening and there was morning, a third day."
"And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years:"
and let them be for lights in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
"And God made the two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: `he made' the stars also."
"And God set them in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth,"
"and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good."
"And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day."
"And God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven."
"And God created the great sea-monsters, and every living creature that moveth, wherewith the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind: and God saw that it was good."
"And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth."
"And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day."
"And God said, Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind, cattle, and creeping things, and beasts of the earth after their kind: and it was so."
"And God made the beasts of the earth after their kind, and the cattle after their kind, and everything that creepeth upon the ground after its kind: and God saw that it was good."
"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth."
"And God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them."
"And God blessed them: and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth."
"And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food:"
"and to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the heavens, and to everything that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, `I have given' every green herb for food: and it was so."
"And God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day."
"And the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them."
And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
"And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it; because that in it he rested from all his work which God had created and made."
"These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that Jehovah God made earth and heaven."
"And no plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for Jehovah God had not caused it to rain upon the earth: and there was not a man to till the ground;"
"but there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground."
"And Jehovah God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul."
"And Jehovah God planted a garden eastward, in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed."
"And out of the ground made Jehovah God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil."
"And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became four heads."
"The name of the first is Pishon: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;"
and the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.
And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Cush.
And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth in front of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
"And Jehovah God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it."
"And Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:"
"but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die."
"And Jehovah God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him."
"And out of the ground Jehovah God formed every beast of the field, and every bird of the heavens; and brought them unto the man to see what he would call them: and whatsoever the man called every living creature, that was the name thereof."
"And the man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the heavens, and to every beast of the field; but for man there was not found a help meet for him."
"And Jehovah God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof:"
"and the rib, which Jehovah God had taken from the man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man."
"And the man said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man."
"Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh."
"And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed."
"Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which Jehovah God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of any tree of the garden?"
"And the woman said unto the serpent, Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat:"
"but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die."
"And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:"
"for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil."
"And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat; and she gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat."
"And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves aprons."
And they heard the voice of Jehovah God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Jehovah God amongst the trees of the garden.
"And Jehovah God called unto the man, and said unto him, Where art thou?"
"And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself."
"And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?"
"And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat."
"And Jehovah God said unto the woman, What is this thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat."
"And Jehovah God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, cursed art thou above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:"
"and I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed: he shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel."
"Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy pain and thy conception; in pain thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee."
"And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in toil shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;"
thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;
"in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return."
And the man called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.
"And Jehovah God made for Adam and for his wife coats of skins, and clothed them."
"And Jehovah God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever-"
"therefore Jehovah God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken."
"So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden the Cherubim, and the flame of a sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life."
"And the man knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man with `the help of' Jehovah."
"And again she bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground."
"And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto Jehovah."
"And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And Jehovah had respect unto Abel and to his offering:"
"but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell."
"And Jehovah said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?"
"If thou doest well, shall it not be lifted up? and if thou doest not well, sin coucheth at the door: and unto thee shall be its desire, but do thou rule over it."
"And Cain told Abel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him."
"And Jehovah said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: am I my brother's keeper?"
"And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground."
"And now cursed art thou from the ground, which hath opened its mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;"
"when thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee its strength; a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the earth."
"And Cain said unto Jehovah, My punishment is greater than I can bear."
"Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the ground; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth; and it will come to pass, that whosoever findeth me will slay me."
"And Jehovah said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And Jehovah appointed a sign for Cain, lest any finding him should smite him."
"And Cain went out from the presence of Jehovah, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden."
"And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch."
And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methushael; and Methushael begat Lamech.
"And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah."
And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents and `have' cattle.
And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe.
"And Zillah, she also bare Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah."
"And Lamech said unto his wives: Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; Ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: For I have slain a man for wounding me, And a young man for bruising me:"
"If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, Truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold."
"And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth. For, `said she', God hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel; for Cain slew him."
"And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enosh. Then began men to call upon the name of Jehovah."
"This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him;"
"male and female created he them, and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created."
"And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begat `a son' in his own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth:"
and the days of Adam after he begat Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters.
And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died.
"And Seth lived a hundred and five years, and begat Enosh:"
"and Seth lived after he begat Enosh eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters:"
and all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and he died.
"And Enosh lived ninety years, and begat Kenan."
"and Enosh lived after he begat Kenan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters:"
and all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years: and he died.
"And Kenan lived seventy years, and begat Mahalalel:"
"and Kenan lived after he begat Mahalalel eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons and daughters:"
and all the days of Kenan were nine hundred and ten years: and he died.
"And Mahalalel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared:"
"And Mahalalel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters:"
and all the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died.
"And Jared lived a hundred sixty and two years, and begat Enoch:"
"and Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:"
And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years: and he died.
"And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah:"
"and Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:"
and all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years:
and Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.
"And Methuselah lived a hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech:"
"and Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters."
And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died.
"And Lamech lived a hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son:"
"and he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us in our work and in the toil of our hands, `which cometh' because of the ground which Jehovah hath cursed."
"And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters:"
And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died.
"And Noah was five hundred years old: And Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth."
"And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the ground, and daughters were born unto them,"
that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all that they chose.
"And Jehovah said, My spirit shall not strive with man for ever, for that he also is flesh: yet shall his days be a hundred and twenty years."
"The Nephilim were in the earth in those days, and also after that, when the sons of God came unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them: the same were the mighty men that were of old, the men of renown."
"And Jehovah saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually."
"And it repented Jehovah that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart."
"And Jehovah said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the ground; both man, and beast, and creeping things, and birds of the heavens; for it repenteth me that I have made them."
But Noah found favor in the eyes of Jehovah.
"These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, `and' perfect in his generations: Noah walked with God."
"And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth."
"And the earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence."
"And God saw the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth."
"And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth."
"Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch."
"And this is how thou shalt make it: the length of the ark three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits."
"A light shalt thou make to the ark, and to a cubit shalt thou finish it upward; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it."
"And I, behold, I do bring the flood of waters upon this earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; everything that is in the earth shall die."
"But I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee."
"And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female."
"Of the birds after their kind, and of the cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive."
"And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them."
"Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he."
"And Jehovah said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation."
"Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee seven and seven, the male and his female; and of the beasts that are not clean two, the male and his female:"
"of the birds also of the heavens, seven and seven, male and female, to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth."
"For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living thing that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the ground."
And Noah did according unto all that Jehovah commanded him.
And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.
"And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood."
"Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of birds, and of everything that creepeth upon the ground,"
"there went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, male and female, as God commanded Noah."
"And it came to pass after the seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth."
"In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened."
And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
"In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;"
"they, and every beast after its kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind, every bird of every sort."
"And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh wherein is the breath of life."
"And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God commanded him: and Jehovah shut him in."
"And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lifted up above the earth."
"And the waters prevailed, and increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters."
And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high mountains that were under the whole heaven were covered.
Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.
"And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both birds, and cattle, and beasts, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:"
"all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, of all that was on the dry land, died."
"And every living thing was destroyed that was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and creeping things, and birds of the heavens; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only was left, and they that were with him in the ark."
And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days.
"And God remembered Noah, and all the beasts, and all the cattle that were with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters assuaged;"
"the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;"
and the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters decreased.
"And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat."
"And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen."
"And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:"
"and he sent forth a raven, and it went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth."
"And he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;"
"but the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him to the ark; for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: and he put forth his hand, and took her, and brought her in unto him into the ark."
And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;
"and the dove came in to him at eventide; and, lo, in her mouth an olive-leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth."
"And he stayed yet other seven days, and sent forth the dove; and she returned not again unto him any more."
"And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dried."
"And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dry."
"And God spake unto Noah, saying,"
"Go forth from the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee."
